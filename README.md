Drowsiness-detection-using-YOLOv5
This repository contains the codebase and resources for a drowsiness detection system leveraging YOLOv5, aimed at detecting and alerting instances of drowsiness in real-time video streams. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to identify facial cues associated with drowsiness, contributing to safety measures in various environments.

Requirements

 1. Python 3.x
 2. YOLOv5
 3. OpenCV (Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt)

git clone https://github.com/username/drowsiness-detection.git
pip install -r requirements.txt

Acknowledgments

 1. YOLOv5 by Ultralytics
 2. OpenCV community
 3. Contributors and developers of related libraries and tools

Instructions
To use this project run the app.py file using cmd
Drowsiness Detection.ipynb was used to train the custom model using yolov5 on a custom dataset using Imglabel
best.pt is the trained model we are using in app.py
